Essentials for Later Development
Persistent Data Storage:
Database Integration: Replace the in-memory storage with a database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or similar. This will ensure that your data persists across server restarts and can be scaled as your application grows.
Data Models: Define robust data models/schema for submissions and votes. This helps in managing and querying data more efficiently.
Authentication and Authorization:
Wallet Integration: Since youâ€™re using Web3 modal for authentication, ensure that the wallet integration is secure and efficient.
User Authentication: Securely authenticate users based on their wallet addresses and potentially add a second layer of verification if necessary.
Error Handling and Validation:
Robust Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling in the backend to manage and respond to errors gracefully.
Data Validation: Validate incoming data to prevent incorrect or malicious data from being processed.
Nice-to-Haves for Enhanced Functionality
Real-Time Updates:
WebSockets or Polling: Implement WebSockets for a real-time user experience, especially for displaying live voting results and market data updates.
Push Notifications: Inform users about important events (e.g., market changes, voting results) through real-time notifications.
Advanced Market Features:
Dynamic Pricing Algorithm: Implement or integrate a more complex algorithm for better prediction market dynamics.
Historical Data Analysis: Provide historical analysis of market predictions and outcomes to enhance user trust and engagement.
User Experience Improvements:
Interactive UI Components: Enhance the frontend with interactive charts and visualizations using libraries like D3.js or Chart.js for market data.
Mobile Optimization: Ensure the application is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
Security Enhancements:
Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse by limiting how frequently a user can make requests to the API.
Audit and Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual activities or performance issues.
Scalability Considerations:
Load Balancing: Prepare for scaling your application with load balancing techniques.
Microservices Architecture: If expecting significant growth, consider adopting a microservices architecture to make scaling individual components of your app easier.
